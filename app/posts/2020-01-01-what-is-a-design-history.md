When designing and building a service, it can be easy to forget why previous decisions were made, even more so as new people join the team and others leave. A design history can help by creating a permanent record.

You can think of a design history as being like a blog, with posts describing the development of new features, iterations of existing ones or findings from user research – anything that may be useful to return to later.

This design history tool was originally developed by the Becoming a teacher team at the Department for Education. Keeping a design history meant they could:

* re-evaluate decisions
* see how a feature changed over time
* see how things tested in research
* give context to new team members
* capture reasons why certain features what didn’t work
* create snapshots of how things looked at significant milestones
* share design decisions across government
* share everything with service assessors

As of February 2020, the [Becoming a teacher design history](https://bat-design-history.netlify.app) includes more than 200 posts documenting 5 different services.<!-- You can learn more about how and why the team created their design history on the [DfE Digital blog](#tbd).-->
